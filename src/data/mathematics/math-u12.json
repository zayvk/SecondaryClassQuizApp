        "Getting an A and getting a B in the same test"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time. Flipping heads and tails on the same coin are impossible simultaneously."

        "1/2",
        "3/4",
        "1"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The probability of red is 1/4 and the probability of blue is 1/4. Since these are mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities."

        "3/8",
        "1/2"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Since the marble is replaced, the events are independent. The probability of green on each draw is 2/8 = 1/4, so (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16."
